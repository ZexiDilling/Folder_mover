This programs listen to a folder to see if new folders are created
If a new folder is created it will store that folder until one more folder is created.
When the next folder is created, it assumes that all files that needs to go to the first folder are done,
and will move the folder and its content to a new location.

The location can either be just a main folder, or can be sorted by year and month.

There is a sorting function, that can be used to move folders that are already created,
or clean up a folder with lots of folders.
